      <h2 class="thesis-heading-2">Highlights</h2>
      <ul role="list" class="list">
        <li class="thesis-text">We connect Seed, Series A and Series B SaaS companies that pass our evaluation model to the VCs, debt providers and PE funds that are most interested in investing in them<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text">Founders are given a thorough evaluation of their investment-readiness, either moving forward to be connected with investors or given constructive feedback on how to move forward<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text">Investors are provided with a consistent flow of relevant, thoroughly diligenced companies with the following documentation available:<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text indent">Investment memo<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text indent">Investment deck<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text indent">Organisational chart<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text indent">Key personnel bios<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text indent">Growth model<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text indent">Operational model<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text indent">Systems and processes map<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text">When it comes to raising investment, we only take fees upon successfully raising an investment. Our focus is on building long-term partnerships with both our investors and founders, ensuring that our incentives stay aligned<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text">We also provide cost-price consulting services focused on constructing the foundations of the growth, sales, strategic financial planning and efficient operations functions that investors are looking for when investing in early-stage businesses in the current market environment<br></li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="thesis-heading-2">What we do</h2>
      <p class="thesis-text">At Modules Ventures our mission is to create a world full of companies we are excited to invest in, provide debt to or acquire: companies with great products, strategic foresight, sustainable growth and efficient operations.<br><br>We love ‘boring’ companies that are doing all the right things in industries that are primed for long term growth.<br><br>We believe that by making the path to fundraising for these kinds of businesses as simple as possible, we can incentivise founders to build the kinds of businesses we are most excited to invest in.<br><br>We drive this change we want to see in the investing world by providing five key services to the founders and investors in our network:</p>
      <ul role="list" class="list">
        <li class="numberedlist">We run a rigorous diligence process on every company you’ll find on our platform designed to answer 80% of the questions investors have about a company before the first call<br></li>
        <li class="numberedlist">We run a rigorous diligence process on every investor that we invite onto our network to ensure that they are only matched with companies where they can add significant value, have aligned incentives and a strong track record in the space<br></li>
        <li class="numberedlist">We match founders that pass our evaluation model with the ideal investors for their requirements through a thorough two-way matching process and manage all back-and-forth communication required to get a deal closed<br></li>
        <li class="numberedlist">We build out high quality investment documents in a standardised format that answer the another 15% of the more complex questions investors need to know about a business before investing<br></li>
        <li class="numberedlist">We prime early-stage companies for investment by working with them to implement best practices for early-stage companies across their growth, finance, operations and fundraising functions<br></li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="thesis-heading-2">Stage, Sectors and Geography</h2>
      <p class="thesis-text">We are presently focused deeply on B2B, B2E and B2G SaaS businesses based in the USA and raising their Seed, Series A and Series B rounds.<br><br>Seed stage companies will be matched with:</p>
      <ul role="list" class="microlist">
        <li class="thesis-text">Early stage VCs<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text">Angel investors and syndicates<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text">Micro-PE funds<br></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="thesis-text">Series A and B companies will be matched with:</p>
      <ul role="list" class="microlist">
        <li class="thesis-text">Growth stage VCs<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text">Angel investors and syndicates<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text">Debt providers across:<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text indent">Venture debt providers<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text indent">Revenue based financing providers<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text indent">Private banks<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text">Micro-PE funds<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text">Family offices<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text">Strategic investors<br></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="thesis-text">We operate an 80/20 deal flow demographic model where we aim for 80% of the investments and investors on our platform to meet the above criteria, and the remaining 20% will consist of exciting investments and investors from other stages, sectors and regions.<br><br>This model allows us to validate whether it’s worth expanding our deal flow demographics into those spaces, without removing our primary focus from the deals that are most interesting to our investor network right now.<br><br>We hope that this model will provide our founder and investor partners with the smooth, efficient fundraising process they expect from working with us, while also opening their eyes to exciting growth opportunities they may not have previously thought about.</p>
      <h2 class="thesis-heading-2">Market Opportunity</h2>
      <p class="thesis-text">From an investor perspective, there has never been a better time to invest in startups, as long as those startups survive and thrive during the upcoming downturn.<br><br>We strongly believe that our thorough evaluation model is a great lens through which to filter for companies that will survive and thrive in the upcoming downturn.<br><br>We’ll regularly provide you with detailed workups on companies that will include:</p>
      <ul role="list" class="microlist">
        <li class="thesis-text">Traditional VC style diligence<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text indent">Team<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text indent">Problem<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text indent">Solution<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text indent">Market sizing<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text indent">Business model validation<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text indent">Value creation<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text indent">Competition<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text indent">Exit opportunity<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text">A validated, growing business. meaning:<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text indent">Significant traction at the Seed stage<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text indent">Nearing PMF for Series A companies<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text indent">PMF reached for Series B companies<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text">A metrics deep dive evaluating up to 36 key SaaS metrics<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text">A sustainable growth model, provided in an interactive format<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text">A scalable business model, provided in an interactive format<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text">Mappings and plans for an efficient, scalable operational model<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text">A prepared plan for reaching break-even in turbulent market conditions<br></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="thesis-text">As an investor, you can filter the opportunities we match you with by:</p>
      <ul role="list" class="microlist">
        <li class="thesis-text">Investment type<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text">Deal size<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text">Minimum cheque size<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text">Company type <br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text">Industry<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text">Region<br></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="thesis-text">Additionally, we will be working with companies directly through our ‘Path toCapital’ program to increase our TAM, which is the total number of companies that pass our evaluation model, thus increasing your deal flow further.<br></p>
      <h2 class="thesis-heading-2">How we make money</h2>
      <p class="thesis-text">We strongly believe that the only way to build a business that ultimately profits from providing dealflow, but is also an unbiased entity that works for the benefit of both the startups and investors we work with is by forging long-term, symbiotic relationships with them, and making the vast majority of our profit on the longest possible time horizon: on success and at liquidation.<br><br>Going forward, all OpEx will be funded by ‘Path to Capital’, a consulting program which is designed to create the kinds of companies that we’d love to invest in, but also provides a massive amount of stand-alone value to companies who do not need our help to raise capital.<br><br>While companies who go through ‘Path to Capital’ will have an ideal set of investment documents as a result of going through the program, they will receive no special treatment when it comes to how we present them to investors.<br><br>They may receive a personal recommendation from our team as a result of us having worked with them, but this is no different to a recommendation we’d give to founders we know who haven’t gone through the program.<br><br>100% of our consulting revenues will be dedicated to OpEx, we are not building a consulting firm, we are building an investment fund, but this consulting revenue allows us to remove what we feel is the biggest GP/LP incentive misalignment in the traditional VC model: management fees.<br><br>Beyond our OpEx, all of our profits will be generated either by successfully helping a company to raise a round of investment, or upon a liquidation event for one of those companies.<br><br>The 12 month goal for Modules Ventures is to build up a sufficiently strong reputation as a source of great deal flow, raise the bar for how investors evaluate the companies they invest in and raise a series of investment funds across VC, debt and micro-PE that will allow us to lead rounds that investors in our network can excitedly join us on.<br><br>We aim to do this by charging for our services in the following ways:<br><br><span class="thesis-text-bold">Equity Financing</span><br><br>Upon helping a company successfully raise a round of equity financing, we willtake a success fee from the amount raised of:<br></p>
      <ul role="list" class="microlist">
        <li class="thesis-text">0.5% where the amount raised is above $10,000,000<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text">1% when the amount raised is above $5,000,000<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text">2% on amounts raised below $5,000,000<br></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="thesis-text">The aim is to take roughly $50,000 upon a successful raise, which we believe to be a very reasonable fee for the level of service we’re providing at no up-front cost.<br><br>Additionally, when working with VC funds we will take 20% of the carry that VC makes on the deal, similar to the ways VC scouts are traditionally compensated, but with a much higher level of service.<br><br>Where an investor is investing their own money, we will take 20% of the carry on the overall deal, similar to the way a VC fund would be compensated, but without the huge pain of management fees.<br><br><span class="thesis-text-bold">Debt Financing <br></span><br>The success fee on all debt financing deals is simply 2x of the equity financing deals:</p>
      <ul role="list" class="microlist">
        <li class="thesis-text">1% where the amount raised is above $10,000,000<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text">2% when the amount raised is above $5,000,000<br></li>
        <li class="thesis-text">4% on amounts raised below $5,000,000<br></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="thesis-text">The reason we take a higher success fee on debt deals is that unlike the equity financing model, in place of a carry structure, we will take a warrant on the deal that allows us to invest in their next round of qualified financing equal to the amount we helped them to raise.<br><br>We take no money out of the back-end of the deal, we simply use this as an opportunity to provide us great avenues to invest in companies with the fund we raise and validate high quality deal flow to fund LPs.<br><br><span class="thesis-text-bold">Micro-PE Acquisitions<br></span><br>Micro PE acquisitions fee structured will be designed on a deal-by-deal basis, as the majority of these deals will involve significant and bespoke involvement from Modules Ventures as an ongoing operational partner.</p>
      <h2 class="thesis-heading-2">What&#x27;s next</h2>
